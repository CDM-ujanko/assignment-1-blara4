        <h1> Hello </h1>
        <h3> My name is Brenda Lara. I'm a junior in DePaul University and transferred from Harold Washington College last year.
        <br>
        I was born and raised in Chicago. I love and take pride in my Mexican heritage. I'm a first-gen student who is still learning how to do this college thing with sanity.
        <br>
        I love dogs and practically any kind of food. </h3>
